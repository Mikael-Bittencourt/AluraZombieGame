# AluraZombieGame
This game was made following the Alura courses, Unity part 1,2,3,4. I learned many things in this course like how to use Unity's particle system to create any desired effects, How to make animations function via script, How to make elements in the game only appear depending on the platform the user is currently on and much more.
